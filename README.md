Datavid Cake Tracker is meant to be a management tool where you can add all the Datavid members together with their birthdays in order to celebrate everyone. Being a remote multinational company makes these things harder to track and hence the Datavid Cake Tracker has the goal to solve these problems.

In order to better assess your software development skills we invite you take part in the first phase of this project. This small phase challenges you to build a simple web application using Angular (latest version) and NodeJS fulfilling the following requirements: 

    Add birthday page
        The user must be able to add the following attributes for a new Datavid member to be registered in the Datavid Cake Tracker: First Name, Last Name, Birth date, Country, City;
        The following constraints apply:
        All the fields are mandatory;
            Country needs to be added from a controlled list (from a fixed set of values);
            All Datavid members should be older than 18 years old;
            Only one user with the same first name, last name and location can be added;
    View birthdays
        The user must be able to see all the registered members and their information in a list view;
        The user should be able to see the members sorted by the closest birthday to the current day;

e.g.: Suppose that we're on the 24th of June and we have the following members registered in the Datavid Cake Tracker, then the order is:

    Adrian, 24.08
    Alex, 01.11
    John 15.03


Non Functional Requirements

    Use any persistence layer you would like (memory, disk, database);
    Use the latest version of Angular (https://angular.io/);
    The use of Angular Material is encouraged (https://material.angular.io);
    The use of ExpressJS in the NodeJS backend project is encouraged (https://expressjs.com);


When reviewing the project, we'll be having an eye on the:

    functionality - make sure that all the requested requirements are fulfilled;
    presentation - ability to present and explain the project;
    code - structure, code design, readability,  maintainability, reusability;
